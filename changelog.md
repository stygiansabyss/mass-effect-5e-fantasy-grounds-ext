- Fixed a bug with health dice
  - The global for the roll wasn't being set when a roll wasnt a damage roll.  Moved setting the variables higher and it now shows correctly.

- Added unique skills
- Removed unneeded skills
- Changed power cast cycler to use Mass Effect classes instead of DnD classes
